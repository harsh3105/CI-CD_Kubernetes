                The first Mercedes-Benz S-Class was launched in 1951. Daimler-Benz, the predecessor of Mercedes-Benz, introduced the 220 and 300 products at the first Frankfurt Motor Show. These two models were the first generation of the S-Class, but under the Ponton name at the time , Without using the term S-Class, but this represents the beginning of the glory era of the S-Class. The 220 at that time was equipped with a new 2.2-liter six-cylinder engine with a maximum power of 80 horsepower. In 1954, Mercedes-Benz introduced the 220a series, equipped with an improved 6-cylinder engine. In addition, the single pivot joint swing bridge with a low pivot point developed for the W196F1 racing car was also used for the first time in Mercedes-Benz production cars, further improving handling.</p>

                　In March 1954, Mercedes-Benz launched the 220 a sedan (W180), also called "Ponton", based on the 180 (W120) series. The overall design of the Mercedes-Benz 220 a is more modern. The styling and design are the same as those of the Mercedes-Benz 180 model launched in 1953, and its slightly different proportion design gives the car an unquestionable elegance. The wheelbase of the Mercedes-Benz 220 a is 170 mm longer than that of the Mercedes-Benz 180 series, of which 70 mm expands the legroom of the rear seats, and the other 100 mm extends the front end length of the vehicle body to provide the necessary installation space for the six-cylinder engine. Two years after the launch of the Mercedes-Benz 220a, the Mercedes-Benz 219 (W105) and 220 S (W128) models with "floating" body designs were launched in March 1956. The “buoy” body provides more ample interior space, better external visibility, and unprecedented comfort. In addition, the overall rigidity of the vehicle has been greatly improved, and the weight of the vehicle body has been reduced. While significantly improving safety, it has ensured higher fuel economy.</p>

                In August 1959, Mercedes-Benz announced a thorough improvement of the original passenger car. Driven by the slogan "Striving to create a new six-cylinder engine in a segmented market," Mercedes-Benz 220 b, 220 Sb and 220 SEb chassis codenames came out one after another. In addition to differences in specific configurations, the engines of the three new models are also different. The third-generation Mercedes-Benz S-Class has a very spacious and elegant body shape, and the vertically designed headlights echo the Mercedes-Benz's iconic intake grille. The edge of the front engine cover is just designed at the centerline of the headlights, which depicts the entire vehicle level clearly. The real bumper is decorated with a large area of ​​chrome plating. The application of chrome plating is still the best performance method to show the noble temperament of Mercedes-Benz S-Class. Unlike other contemporary models, the third-generation Mercedes-Benz S-Class sets a new standard for passive safety of luxury cars while pursuing a stylish design. In 1955, Mercedes-Benz launched a new luxury car project without budget restrictions, and strived to create a luxury model that created a model of automotive aesthetics and engineering. This is the Mercedes-Benz 600, known as "the most beautiful car in the world". From the 1950s to the early 1960s, world-class luxury cars were mainly occupied by Cadillac and Rolls-Royce, and the heads of state of the world were mostly American cars. Before the birth of the Mercedes-Benz 600, Mercedes-Benz did not absolutely establish its position as the king of world-class luxury cars.</p>

                In August 1965, Mercedes-Benz launched a new generation of flagship models designed by Paul Bracq. The simple lines return to the classic design of Mercedes-Benz. In March 1968, Mercedes-Benz reached a new high with the launch of the top model 300 SEL 6.3. The car uses an eight-cylinder engine and automatic transmission of the Mercedes-Benz 600. Because nothing was announced before, the debut of the 300 SEL 6.3 at the Geneva Motor Show triggered a powerful sensation. In appearance, the most significant feature of the 300 SEL 6.3 is the use of wider tires, dual halogen headlights and auxiliary high-beam headlights. The engine's power reached 250 hp (184 kW), and the powerful torque of 500 Newton-meters made the acceleration time of the 300 SEL 6.3 from 0 to 100 km / h in only 8 seconds, and the maximum speed reached 225 km / h. The fastest production car in the world.</p>

                1972 was a milestone in the history of the Mercedes-Benz S-Class. In that year, the 280 S, 280 SE and 350 SE cars with the internal number W116 series were officially listed, and were officially officially named "Mercedes" for the first time. -Benz S-Class. " In May 1975, Mercedes-Benz released the new top model of the series-450 SEL 6.9, which is also the true successor of the Mercedes-Benz 300 SEL 6.3 model. The powerful 6.9-liter V8 engine was developed by Mercedes-Benz's highly successful 6.3-liter engine, achieving a power output of up to 286 hp (210 kW) and a maximum torque of 549 N · m, with a maximum speed of 230 per hour The 6.9 liter displacement is also the largest production German passenger car by far. In terms of safety, this generation of S-Class sedan uses a number of innovative technologies, including the world's first mass-produced ABS anti-lock braking system, a four-spoke safety steering wheel, an anti-collision fuel tank, a safety door handle, and anti-fouling Side windows and taillights. The ABS system is already a common configuration that is commonplace, but at the time, ABS caused a huge sensation as soon as it was launched. The successor to this generation of the S-Class series, the W 126, was unveiled at the Frankfurt International Motor Show in September 1979, but the W116 series did not stop production immediately, but gradually phased out from April to September 1980.</p>

                In September 1979, Daimler-Benz introduced a new generation of S-Class cars at the Frankfurt International Auto & Parts Fair. The W 126 series originally consisted of seven models: four engines (from a 2.8-liter 115-kW / 156-horsepower six-cylinder carburetor engine to a 5.0-liter 176 kW / 240-horsepower direct-injection V8 light-structure alloy engine) And two other models-regular and extended. The wheelbase of the longer version has been increased by 140 mm, which has significantly improved the rear legroom and rear door entrance width. Consistent with its predecessor model, this generation of Mercedes-Benz S-Class also has a lot of effort in terms of safety performance. Thanks to the new design concept, the passenger compartment can withstand a frontal impact at a speed of 55 kilometers per hour, and the W 126 series of cars has thus become the world's first car to reach the standard of frontal impact resistance. Two years after the launch of the W 126 series, the Mercedes-Benz S-Class took the lead in applying driver's airbags, and added front passenger airbags to the 1985 model improvement package, becoming another area of ​​automotive safety design. Create. The most noticeable innovation in this car's engine is the 5.6-liter 8-cylinder engine, which was developed by increasing the stroke of the 5.0-liter V8 engine and has an output of 200 kilowatts (272 horsepower). Models equipped with this engine, the 560 SEL and 560 SEC, were the most powerful production models of Mercedes-Benz at the time.</p>

                In March 1991, the new S-Class (W140 series) debuted at the Geneva Motor Show. Like the predecessor series of the W126 series and several generations of Mercedes-Benz premium series models, the new version of the S-Class sedan also launched a long wheelbase model with a wheelbase lengthened by 100 mm to increase rear legroom. The newly designed 6.0-liter V12 engine was the first 12-cylinder engine mass-produced by Mercedes-Benz for passenger cars. It was one of the most powerful passenger car engines at the time, with a rated power output of 300 kilowatts (408 horsepower). Peak torque reaches 580 Nm, and at 1600 rpm, strong torque of up to 500 Nm can be achieved. In June 1993, this model was unified with other sedan series models. The "S" was placed before the three-digit number, and the letter suffixes "E", "D", and "L" were omitted. For example, the 500 SE became the S 500, and under the new naming system, the 600 SEL was renamed the S 600 long wheelbase. Since then, the luggage compartment only indicates the model level and engine displacement, not the body version (ordinary or long wheelbase version)-it is not difficult to detect if you look closely. The most significant change is the redesign of the 4.2-liter and 6-cylinder models. The numbers are rounded to the nearest hundred, in order to improve the uniformity of the overall image. The numbers used correspond to the actual displacement.</p>

                At the Paris Motor Show in September 1998, Mercedes-Benz released six S-Class cars numbered W 220. Compared to its predecessors, the W 220 series gives a more intuitive impression. At the beginning of the debut, the new S-Class sedan demonstrated to the public more than thirty innovative technological achievements, including an intelligent cruise control system with limited distance, a navigation system with traffic alarm function, and automatic cylinder closing technology. In 2002, Mercedes-Benz introduced the world's first PRE-SAFE preventive safety system, and it was the first to be equipped on the S car. As one of the important configurations of the new generation of S-Class cars today, AIRMATIC with adaptive damping system also appeared in the eighth-generation S-Class cars. In addition, the vehicle is also equipped with a newly developed four-link front suspension system and ESP electronically controlled vehicle stability driving system. Starting from the 2002 model, the S-Class has standard COMAND cab management and data systems on all of its models, while adding automatic navigation systems to its top S 600 models. In the autumn of 2002, Mercedes-Benz continued to upgrade the power system of the W 220 models and began to equip 6- and 8-cylinder S-Class cars with 4MATIC full-time four-wheel drive systems. With the assistance of ESP? (Electronically Controlled Vehicle Stable Driving System), ASR (Accelerated Anti-Slip System) and 4ETS (Four-wheel Drive Electronic Traction System) electronic driving safety system, 4MATIC makes S-Class cars easily meet the challenges of various complex road conditions. What's more, the twin-turbocharged V 12 engine was first used in the Mercedes-Benz S 600 model. This breathtaking, high-performance engine is capable of producing superb output powers of up to 500 hp (368 kW) and amazing torque of 800 N · m.</p>
